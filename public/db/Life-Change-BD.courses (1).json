    "description": "The Holy Quran is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It consists of 114 chapters, known as surahs, which vary in length, and cover a wide range of topics, including theology, morality, guidance for personal conduct, and legal principles. The Quran is written in Arabic and is highly regarded for its literary and linguistic excellence. It addresses matters of faith, worship, social justice, and provides stories of past prophets and communities as lessons for believers. It is divided into verses called ayahs, and it serves as the foundational source of guidance for Muslims in matters of faith and practice.",
